## Domain Config

<Steps>

1. Go to your DNS Registrar (e.g., Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare).

2. Locate your DNS Records section.

3. Add an "A Record" with the following information:
   - Name: Use @ for the whole domain or enter a subdomain
   - IPV4 Address: Your server's IPV4 Address

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
  This guide uses Cloudflare as an example, but the process is similar for other DNS providers.
</Aside>

## Apache Config

<Steps>

1. SSH into your server with sudo privileges.

2. Update and upgrade your system:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

3. Install Apache:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apache2
   ```

4. Enable necessary Apache modules:
   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod proxy
   sudo a2enmod proxy_http
   sudo a2enmod proxy_balancer
   sudo a2enmod lbmethod_byrequests
   ```

5. Restart Apache:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

6. Configure the webserver:
   ```bash
   cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
   sudo cp 000-default.conf dashboard.conf
   sudo nano dashboard.conf
   ```

7. Edit the `dashboard.conf` file with the following configuration:
   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
           ServerName your-domain.com
           ProxyRequests On
           ProxyPreserveHost On

           ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
           ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

           ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
           CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

8. Enable the new site configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo a2ensite dashboard.conf
   sudo systemctl reload apache2
   ```

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Remember to replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain and adjust the port number if your bot is running on a different port.
</Aside>

## Discord Application Redirect

<Steps>

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

2. Select your application and navigate to OAuth2 -> General.

3. Add two redirects to your dashboard:
   - `http://your-domain.com/callback`
   - `https://your-domain.com/callback`

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  Use `http` or `https` depending on whether you have SSL configured for your domain.
</Aside>

## Conclusion

You should now be able to access and log in to your bot's dashboard using your custom domain. If you encounter any issues, double-check your configurations and ensure all services are running correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, please:

1. Check the Heroku logs for any error messages.
2. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set.
