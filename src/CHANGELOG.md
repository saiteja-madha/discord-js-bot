# Mochi v1.0.2

## New

- 📜 Stats and invites will be tracked by default

## Fixes & Improvements

- Moved `CHANGELOG.md` to `src/CHANGELOG.md` folder
- Improved `bot changelog` command to reduce headings of the embeded changelog
- Fixed `leaderboard` command in which servers whose leaderboard is not set
  would send error instead of explaining it
- fixed image base url, rank card now uses infinity API.

## Developer Notes

- ⚙️ removed `npm run format` from the `npm run update` script to eliminate the
  possibility of formatting an already formatted code resulting in git errors
- ⚙️ excluded `docs` folder from `npm run format` script to prevent formatting
  the documentation files, which breaks links in gitbook.
